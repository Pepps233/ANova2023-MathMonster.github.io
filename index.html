          In MathMonsters, players will be prompted a question, typing the question in the bar below and pressing enter: Answering the 
          question correctly allows the aircraft to shoot a projectile to defeat an alien ahead of them, answering the question incorrectly
          does not do anything. -> There will be a new question that is prompted for the player to answer and re-try defeating the alien.
